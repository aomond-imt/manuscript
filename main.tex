\subsection{Reconfiguration solutions for self-adaptive systems}

\subsubsection{MAPE-K model}

When dealing with self-adaptive systems, it is common to refer to the MAPE-K model~\cite{kephart_vision_2003}. The MAPE-K model is an abstraction proposed by IBM to help designing self-adaptive systems. The MAPE-K model is composed of four functions (MAPE) that have a common knowledge (K). The four functions are the Monitor (M), Analyse (A), Plan (P) and Execution (E) functions. Each function represents a specific step of the adaptation. The common knowledge represents the set of data or framework that are shared between the MAPE functions. This knowledge enables the collaboration between the different MAPE functions.
 
The MAPE model is often represented as a loop. Each function of the MAPE relies on the output of the previous one. Each function is responsible for its own part of the adaptation and provides results to the next function. 

The Monitor function is responsible for collecting information from the system. Such information can be extracted from the underlying host (\eg resource usage, remaining energy, software version, failure), the network (\eg neighbors discovery, contention, connectivity) or the physical environment (\eg heat). These information can be combined and transformed to construct the different metrics relevant for the adaptation. Such metrics can be related to the Quality of Service, software obsolescence, node's lifetime maximisation, etc. These metrics are provided to the next function of the loop, the Analysis function.

%Different kind of information can be extracted according to the target adaptation use-case. Monitoring software version can enable automatic updates. Monitoring resource usage can enable automatic load-balancing. Monitoring link quality with neighbors can enable automatic switching between radio technology or its parameters.

%for  represents the collection of metrics relevant for the adaptation. Such metrics can be any metric that helps the adaptation. It can be local metrics such as current resource utilisation (\eg CPU, memory), remaining energy, software/hardware failure, etc. It can also be external metrics such as metrics from physical sensors (\eg heat) or from other devices (\eg connectivity, devices entering/leaving the network). 
%This step gathers such metrics that serve as input for the Analysis step. 

The Analysis function is responsible for the decision about whether or not to adapt based on the received metrics from the Monitor function. The Analysis function usually has a set of rules or goals that the system should to respect. The received metrics help the Analysis function to evaluate whether or not these goals are respected. Based on this evaluation, the Analysis function decides whether or not an adaptation is required to reach the desired goals. 

When an adaptation is necessary, the Analysis function computes the target state the system should reach. In the context of distributed services, the state of a system can be represented by the configuration of all services deployed on the system (\eg software version, active/inactive, etc). In this case, the target state of the system represents a configuration of services that should help matching the desired goals. The computation of the different steps and actions to go from the current to the target state is done by the next function, the Plan.

%to ensure that the system respects a pre-defined set of rules or goals. This function is responsible for the decision about whether or not an adaptation is required to reach a new state to better fit the pre-defined rules. to take decision based on the metrics provided by the Monitor function. This  The state of a node is defined as its current software configuration (\eg installed and running services). Such step usually define a set of goals and metrics thresholds that a device should respect. Such goal can be related to the Quality of Service (\eg ensuring that the device is able to sustain a specific load, ensuring that the remaining energy is enough for the device to continue working for a specific duration, etc). From the given metrics, the node checks if the goal are respected. If it is not the case, the node decide a target state that the node should have to respect the goals. The current and target state are given to the Plan step. 

The Plan is responsible for the creation and scheduling of the different actions and steps to go from the current to the target state given by the Analysis function. The actions aim at reconfiguring part of the system (\eg installation, update, activation of services). The reconfigurable parts of the system and the rules to modify these should be exposed. Notably, the system architecture and relationship between its parts should be exposed. Adapting dependent services can lead to failure when proceed uncorrectly. Applying proper scheduling of adaptation actions ensures the safety and consistency of the system at each step of the Plan. The scheduling of actions is given to the final function of the loop, the Execution function.

The Execution function is responsible for the execution of actions given by the Plan. Each action implements concrete modifications on the system. The Execution function is responsible to ensure that each modification is done following the proper schedule from the Plan (\eg synchronisation between actions). Once the Execution is completed, the loop goes back to the Monitor function.

To enable collaboration between MAPE functions, data are shared between functions. The Monitor function needs to know what kind of metrics the Analysis function requires. The Analysis function requires knowledge about the current state of the system, including the deployed architecture and its configuration. The Plan and Execution functions need a common framework to define actions and execute them.

As said previously, the MAPE loop is an abstraction. It doesn't give any information about how each function is implemented on the underlying system. In the literature, adaptation solution often have different patterns, that suit different use-cases.

%It is responsible for the coordination of the actions following the schedule given by the Plan.

%The plan is composed of the actions, commands or instructions allowing to go from one state to an other. These can be actions such as the activation/deactivation of services, installation/update of services. 

%Changing the state of a system can lead to inconsistencies. The definition and execution of the Plan should take into consideration the architecture of the system. In a system, services may be dependent on each other. Adapting such services can lead to failure when dependencies are not handled correctly. 

%In the Plan step, the node creates the adaptation steps required to go from the current to the target state. In order to compute the Plan, the node needs to have a representation of its current state. This state can be defined as  The creation of the Plan ensures that the actions order keep the system in a coherent state (\eg dependencies order between services is respected). When the Plan is created, it is given to the Execution step.

%In the Execution step, the node executes each step of the Plan. The Execution is ordered by the dependency between each action (\eg order of precedence). 
%Finally, the Knowledge relates to any kind of shared Knowledge used between the MAPE steps. For example, the Knowledge can be a shared framework and software that links together all MAPE steps. In the context of reconfiguration, the Knowledge can also be the representation of the deployed infrastructure. This can notably be used by the Analysis and Plan steps to compute the target state from the current. 

\subsubsection{MAPE-K patterns for reconfiguration solutions}
As stated previously, the MAPE loop is an abstraction. Each step can be implemented in different ways to suit any use-case. A first simple example is the centralized pattern, the whole MAPE loop is controlled by a single entity. This entity implements each step of the loop.

%Some steps can be done in parallel, others are done sequentially. Some steps of the Plan can be related to each other. In this case, the Execution has to wait for the tasks it relies on before continuing.
